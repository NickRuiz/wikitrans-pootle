	  structure of templating to support this better - rather than
	  having big dictionary per user, separate out rights and handle
	  selection in the template restructured projects.getrights to
	  support this better, including returning None if no rights
	  defined and usedefaults is set to False added method
	  getuserswithrights to projects to support this page corrected
	  unicode problems by calling .__xxxattr__() rather than xxxattr()
	  handle unicode keys in argument handling section (note that fixes
	  to jToolkit's pref handling that this uncovered will be in
	  jToolkit 0.7.7)

	  (Pootle-kid-conversion): replaced language page with templated
	  version started replacing fileindex with templated version - this
	  is a big job, this is part 1 goals and directories are templated,

	  address with the fullname try handle settting all the parameters
	  correctly

2005-10-21 15:13  davidfraser

	* adminpages.py: fixed mistaken variable name that made all the new
	  entry items checkboxes

2005-10-21 15:00  davidfraser

	* pootle.py: remove templating - rather move towards a better
	  structure later

2005-10-18 16:08  davidfraser

	* adminpages.py: wrong word - projects is actually a module, we're
	  looking at languages here

2005-10-11 10:19  davidfraser

	* pootlefile.py: update to work with new checker.run_filters return
	  style

2005-08-09 00:16  dwaynebailey

	* templates/: adminindex.html, adminlanguages.html,
	  adminprojects.html, adminusers.html: Made encoding UTF-8 as these
	  pages will contain UTF-8 encoded content.

2005-08-05 13:49  dwaynebailey

	* projects.py: This partially fixes:
	  http://bugs.wordforge.org/show_bug.cgi?id=28

	  We now do not use strings that are marked fuzzy with pootle live
	  translation.

2005-08-03 15:54  davidfraser

	* adminpages.py, templates/adminindex.html,
	  templates/adminlanguages.html, templates/adminprojects.html,
	  templates/adminusers.html: converted languages, projects, users
	  admin pages to use templates

2005-07-27 01:30  dwaynebailey

	* pagelayout.py, html/pootle.css, html/doc/howto.html,
	  html/doc/index.html, html/doc/resources.html: Corrected CSS
	  errors identified using http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator

2005-07-27 01:18  dwaynebailey

	* indexpage.py, pagelayout.py, translatepage.py,
	  html/doc/howto.html, html/doc/index.html,
	  html/doc/resources.html: Make Pootle HTML 4.01 Transitional
	  compliant

2005-07-02 22:51  davidfraser

	* pootle.py: .mo files were being left out...

2005-07-02 22:49  davidfraser

	* pootlefile.py, projects.py: move all the converters out of
	  pootlefile into projects, use the classes automatically (assume
	  it has a convertfile method that takes a pofile object as
	  argument and returns either a string or an object with a tolines
	  method)

2005-07-02 18:55  davidfraser

	* pootle.py, projects.py: the etag needs to be a string or internal
	  comparisons fail and we need to actually return it when serving
	  the file :-)

2005-07-02 18:47  davidfraser

	* pootle.py, projects.py: use the convert function directly from
	  pootle.py to serve converted files it now returns a tuple that is
	  (etag, filepath) if the file is served from disk, or (False,
	  contents) otherwise this is a bit convoluted and hopefully the
	  interface will settle down as more converter standardisation is
	  done

2005-07-02 18:14  davidfraser

	* projects.py: added generic code for caching converted files.

2005-07-02 17:41  davidfraser

	* pootle.py, projects.py: allow getting a pofile without parsing
	  it, and use this to serve .po files straight from disk

2005-07-02 17:31  davidfraser

	* conflict2suggest.py: added conflict2suggest which converts
	  msgmerge conflicts to Pootle suggestions

2005-07-02 16:11  davidfraser

	* pootle.py, projects.py: move DummyStatsProject to projects.py and
	  split off base DummyProject

2005-07-02 16:07  davidfraser

	* conftest.py, test_init.py: added conftest that stops py.test from
	  searching po directory for python tests (which could take hours
	  if its big) and basic init test

2005-07-02 09:07  dwaynebailey

	* README: Change the bug address to bugs.wordforge.org

2005-07-01 23:06  davidfraser

	* projects.py: when we were using the index, we weren't checking
	  the match names.  if using the index, do a separate sesarch
	  (without text matching) for match names added some funny logic to
	  merge the two lists, once they are integrated this should be
	  simpler this should fix
	  http://bugs.wordforge.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6

2005-07-01 22:39  davidfraser

	* translatepage.py: we can't reliably determine positions in
	  strings or changes unless they are unicode due to multibyte
	  characters so decode everything to unicode before calculating
	  differences (and use these strings when displaying the difference
	  markers) fixes http://bugs.wordforge.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4

2005-07-01 20:57  davidfraser

	* __init__.py, __version__.py, adminpages.py, filelocations.py,
	  indexpage.py, pagelayout.py, pootle.py, pootlefile.py, potree.py,
	  projects.py, test_indexing.py, translatepage.py, users.py,
	  versioncontrol.py: added encoding markers for Python source
	  [Simos Xenitellis]

	* README: Added a reference section and a section about reporting
	  bugs.

2005-07-01 09:59  davidfraser

	* translatepage.py: return focus to the input box after copying...

2005-07-01 09:55  davidfraser

	* translatepage.py, CREDITS: prevent bug 2: searching in xxx.po?
	  URL with no results and po file longer than pagesize gives error
	  [Matt Chisholm] added Matt and Simos to CREDITS

2005-06-30 23:26  dwaynebailey

	* translatepage.py: Add acceskeys for the common tasks on the
	  translation interface

2005-06-30 20:39  dwaynebailey

	* indexpage.py, pootle.py, pootlefile.py, projects.py: Allow us to
	  get Qt .ts files from Pootle.  We should I guess introduce a
	  system that allows you to switch on which file types are valid
	  for a project as most will not need .ts files.

2005-06-30 20:14  davidfraser

	* users.py: handle null translations which are still dicts

2005-06-30 16:34  davidfraser

	* pootle.py: if not actually running the webserver, set the
	  servertype to dummy so we don't try to bind the port

2005-06-30 12:00  davidfraser

	* projects.py: fixed bad logic: if items are given we always want
	  to update exactly those items

2005-06-29 10:17  davidfraser

	* translatepage.py: only include spellchecking UI if we can check
	  that language (the values are cached so its not a performance hit
	  to do this each time)

2005-06-28 23:14  davidfraser

	* pootle.py: pass the language code to the spell checker

2005-06-28 23:10  davidfraser

	* translatepage.py: use spell checkable TextArea widgets

	* translatepage.py: make the focus script work with plurals by
	  selecting the first text box

2005-06-28 21:27  davidfraser

	* translatepage.py: set the focus to the textarea so people can
	  start typing straight away

2005-06-28 19:57  davidfraser

	* pootlefile.py: add x_generator member and update PO files to say
	  they have been edited by Pootle revise the way we add headers...

2005-06-28 12:05  davidfraser

	* pootle.py: can't use pofile to get pomtime when we don't have it
	  (for other file types) this should be fixed up later

2005-06-28 11:10  davidfraser

	* pootlefile.py, projects.py: make sure new po files use
	  pootleelement so we can use unquotedmsgstr etc if unquotedmsgstr
	  is a list (as returned by get method) then handle it properly

2005-06-28 11:08  davidfraser

	* potree.py: fixed using same variable name for local and outer
	  variable

2005-06-27 22:09  davidfraser

	* pootle.py: added code to allow HTTP caching of source files using
	  modified time of po file

2005-06-26 21:42  davidfraser

	* __version__.py: version 0.6.3

2005-06-26 21:38  davidfraser

	* translatepage.py: handle blank pofilename in form

	* projects.py: handle quickstats when creating from templates

2005-06-26 21:36  davidfraser

	* projects.py: jToolkit 0.6.5+ uses HAVE_INDEXER not HAVE_PYLUCENE

2005-06-26 21:21  davidfraser

	* TODO, adminpages.py: don't allow people to add templates from
	  templates updated TODO

2005-06-26 21:17  davidfraser

	* pootle.py, potree.py, projects.py: added support for
	  TemplatesProject like TranslationProject but for pot files

2005-06-26 20:45  davidfraser

	* users.py: added ability to set a language for the ui in the user
	  preferences, and logic to make it work nicely   if somebody
	  explicitly selects a language on login, and they don't have
	  uilanguage set, it will be set   if somebody goes to the options
	  page, it will select the first of their chosen languages if
	  uilanguage not set

2005-06-26 20:14  davidfraser

	* pootle.py: get languagenames from getlanguages so it is sorted

	* projects.py: moved search for filenames out of matchessearch and
	  into indexsearch so it isn't repeated for each filename

2005-06-23 17:37  davidfraser

	* projects.py: make sure pofilenames are updated in index in sorted
	  order added items option to updateindex that lets you just update
	  particular items added optimize option to updateindex that lets
	  you not optimize on commit (so a batch optimize can be done
	  later) do a batch optimize on startup make sure quickstats are
	  sorted update the index for a particular item when it is changed

2005-06-23 12:57  davidfraser

	* projects.py: factored out new indexsearch method which
	  understands pootlefile.Search, use this to find items quicker too
	  added note about updating files to help debugging handle
	  lastpofilename being a blank string

2005-06-23 12:32  davidfraser

	* projects.py: fixed up the index updating logic this is now done
	  in one block per pofile, since we need to delete and add in each
	  step and you cannot do both at the same time also use
	  ExactAnalyzer for pofilename so it doesn't try match different
	  parts as words check exactly how many items match the correct
	  pomtime / wrong pomtime and use this to work out whether to
	  update use searcher.makeQuery rather than building PyLucene
	  queries ourselves

2005-06-23 10:10  davidfraser

	* projects.py: adjusted to use jToolkit.data.indexer rather than
	  using PyLucene directly (more advanced locking etc) also store
	  each item separately rather than one document per file update
	  code still needs improvement...

	  but still useful)

2005-05-20 22:56  davidfraser

	* projects.py: redid removefilefromgoal to handle directories
	  properly when file/directory is not direct member of goal cleaned
	  up the getgoalfiles code a bit, make sure it never returns
	  duplicates   made expanddirs return subdirectories as well as
	  subfiles if includedirs (and adjust for browsefiles not returning

	  with dirs, for readability sort goal file list for readability

2005-05-19 21:25  davidfraser

	* projects.py: use better intelligence for working out which
	  partialdirs are already in goaldirs

2005-05-19 15:41  davidfraser

	* adminpages.py: made taldom optional for people who haven't
	  upgraded jToolkit yet

2005-05-19 14:25  dwaynebailey

	* translatepage.py: Create a dropdown of valid users for assigning
	  work in the translate page.

2005-05-19 13:40  dwaynebailey

	* pootlefile.py: We weren't ever actually updating the plural
	  header because we were looking for "nplural" instead of
	  "nplurals".

2005-05-19 13:30  dwaynebailey

	* indexpage.py: You can now only assign users from s dropdown

	  you assign them.

2005-05-19 13:18  dwaynebailey

	* indexpage.py: Add plural forms to various messages

2005-05-19 13:10  dwaynebailey

	* projects.py: Handle the case where thepo.msgstr is not a
	  dictionary

2005-05-19 13:07  dwaynebailey

	* projects.py: Added ungettext function so that we can now display
	  plural translations of Pootel live.

2005-05-17 22:16  davidfraser

	* templates/adminindex.html: added initial template for AdminPage
	  (adminindex.html)

2005-05-17 22:13  davidfraser

	* adminpages.py, pagelayout.py, pootle.py: added initial templates
	  support (Woohoo!) This requires the latest jToolkit (version >=
	  0.6.2) but should gracefully fall back without it basically if a
	  Page object contains the attributes templatename and templatevars
	  it will be constructed from the template and the widgets ignored
	  (if jToolkit version supports templating) This is to enable
	  gradual migration to the templating approach currently only one
	  page is templated as a demonstration, adminpages.AdminPage the
	  basic approach is to pull out all the logic into separate
	  functions, and use the same logic for the widgets and the
	  templates then when migration is complete, all the widgeting code
	  can be deleted :-)

2005-05-14 15:33  dwaynebailey

	* pootle.py: Checks the prefs file for defaultlanguage and will
	  setup the interface to that.	Of course you need all the rest
	  like the translated Pootle files :).	This allows you to run an
	  instance of Pootle in a default or "not logged in" language other
	  than English.

2005-05-14 15:30  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py, pagelayout.py, projects.py: fixed up handling of
	  directories that partially belong to a goal (something inside the
	  directory does) include these in the list of items to display
	  (using new arg includepartial to project.getgoalfiles) display
	  the number of files in the directory that match the goal (e.g.
	  1/2 files) calculate statistics based on the files actually
	  matching the goal, not the whole directory if it is partial

2005-05-14 15:23  dwaynebailey

	* pootle.prefs: Added many comments to make it easy to understand
	  the options and layout of the main prefs file.

2005-05-14 14:54  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py: display goals with no files in the current
	  directory, but don't display action links for them

2005-05-14 14:01  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py: cleaned up goals interface so "show goals" only
	  shows the goals you have to click on a goal to see its files when
	  you've selected a goal, you see only that goal you can now also
	  select "No goal" (exactly the same as a normal goal, but can't
	  add users etc) if there are no users for a goal, don't show the
	  "Set User" button

2005-05-14 13:31  davidfraser

	* pootle.py: changed xliff mime type to xml as it is

2005-05-13 11:45  davidfraser

	* pagelayout.py: fixed links so if at no depth, we don't have a /
	  link (leading to things like /../)

2005-05-13 10:43  davidfraser

	* pootle.py: made commandline refreshstats work on mandrake which
	  has .po directories, and pass the correct relative name not the
	  path to pootlefile

2005-05-13 10:20  davidfraser

	* html/images/language.png: added a funny language icon until we
	  can get a nicer one

2005-05-12 11:18  davidfraser

	* potree.py: reverse order of dir / .po check so that if
	  directories are called "xxx.po" they don't get skipped (e.g.
	  mandrake)

2005-05-11 16:36  davidfraser

	* pootle.py: added ability to specify files to refreshstats on on
	  the commandline recurse directories given for .po files and
	  process files given uses dummy project classes etc

2005-05-10 22:44  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py, projects.py: improved goal handling so it deals
	  with directories and files properly (don't remove initial
	  dirfilter from goalfile name in indexpages as this confuses
	  things) added options to project.getgoalfiles to enable this (and
	  helper function getancestry) - similar to browsefiles, which it
	  uses check that __dummy__ unassigneduser is there before removing
	  it! added code to remove a file if its directory is in the goal
	  (this removes the directory and adds the other filenames)

2005-05-09 20:57  davidfraser

	* translatepage.py: check usernode properly (if
	  self.session.username is None you can't getattr)

2005-05-09 14:10  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py: pass the project to describestats so it can count
	  words

2005-05-09 14:05  davidfraser

	* projects.py: added a countwords method that takes a (pofilename,
	  itemnum) list (as returned by combinedstats)

2005-05-09 13:16  davidfraser

	* pagelayout.py: display wordcounts wherever string counts are
	  (except for checks etc)

2005-05-09 13:14  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py, pagelayout.py: added a method to PootleNavPage
	  called describestats so it can be done consistently renamed
	  self.average -> average throughout

2005-05-07 13:25  davidfraser

	* translatepage.py: handle new stats format (just display number of
	  strings with len)

2005-05-07 13:25  davidfraser

	* pootlefile.py: added wordcounts and remember wordcounts of each
	  item in stats file the format allows wordcounts per plural form,
	  separated by / msgidwordcounts and msgstrwordcounts are lists of
	  lists, each item has a list of wordcounts per plural form

2005-05-07 12:56  davidfraser

	* projects.py: handle assign stats the same as others (use items
	  rather than counts)

2005-05-07 12:47  davidfraser

	* pootlefile.py, projects.py, indexpage.py: replaced statistics'
	  count of items with an actual list of items this means we should
	  be able to get wordcounts etc much more easily replaced
	  calculatestats with a method combinestats that returns a list of
	  pofilename-item tuples string count statistics can easily be
	  calculated with len but other operations should be possible too
	  assignstats still need to be handled

2005-05-07 12:15  davidfraser

	* pootlefile.py: moved pootlefile.classifyelement ->
	  pootleelement.classify made it handle only the singular elements
	  (plurals are tricky) fixed mergeitem adding suggestion in quoted
	  form (this is a bit roundabout)

2005-05-07 12:12  davidfraser

	* pagelayout.py: rootlink should always end in a /

2005-05-07 11:55  davidfraser

	* pootlefile.py, projects.py, translatepage.py: added class
	  pootleelement derived from poelement to allow special methods
	  rather than doing them in pootlefile use pootlelement as the
	  elementclass for pootlefile added unquotedmsgstr and
	  unquotedmsgid properties to pootleelement, use them where
	  appropriate return actual pootleelements rather than msgid,
	  msgstr pairs from getitems, getsuggestions don't need to do
	  quoting/unquoting in projects anymore since using unquotedxxx
	  property

2005-05-06 17:58  davidfraser

	* projects.py, translatepage.py: factored out makeitems from
	  getitems, which puts the po items into an understandable format
	  modified suggestions to use this fixed up missing buttons for
	  single translations made sure non-plural submissions don't come
	  through as plural

2005-05-06 17:23  davidfraser

	* translatepage.py: realized deleting the checks wasn't a good
	  idea... (aborts the search) made the 'currentfolder' in the
	  navbar for translatepage the current po filename rather than the
	  dirfilter (this lets you see where you are)

2005-05-06 17:19  davidfraser

	* TODO: done a few of these, notably plurals!

2005-05-06 17:12  davidfraser

	* translatepage.py: made sure checks don't appear in links clean up
	  the action so that it doesn't come back to the same place (fixes
	  bug where after editing an item it wouldn't move on)

2005-05-06 17:06  davidfraser

	* translatepage.py: - made accepting and rejecting plural
	  suggestions work   this requires having an extra point field in
	  the receivetranslations   fixed up the name of the submitted
	  fields and made sure it contains the pluralsuggestion (was the
	  suggestion dict) - fixed up logic of what self.pofilename means -
	  its the current pofilename being dealt with	that means it can
	  be changed in finditem after receivetranslations has received the
	  submitted translations - ensured that unwanted arguments are
	  cleaned up so they don't affect links   this includes pofilename,
	  item, the receivetranslation arguments and the hidden orig-pure
	  arguments - cleaned up the generation of orig-pure (was
	  orig-hidden) and made copy use the singular

2005-05-06 17:01  davidfraser

	* projects.py: corrected annoying error where items would be
	  skipped because the item variable was not being reset between
	  filenames this basically meant it would only go to items in later
	  filenames if they had more items than the previous filenames

2005-05-06 16:13  davidfraser

	* translatepage.py: redid gettransreview to work with plurals
	  cleaned up leftover bit in receivetranslations

2005-05-06 11:42  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py, translatepage.py: removed unneccessary parameters
	  etc from TranslatePage functions use PootleNavPage for base
	  constructors where thats the base class

2005-05-06 11:34  davidfraser

	* projects.py, translatepage.py: decided we didn't need to pass
	  isplural around everywhere, since we can tell based on the length
	  of the orig/trans lists

2005-05-06 11:23  davidfraser

	* projects.py, translatepage.py: handle plural forms being edited
	  redid handling of submitted arguments to make it less verbose and
	  ponderous (match keytype and items directly rather than trying
	  hundreds of options) for translations submitted, use a dictionary
	  (like msgstr) if they are plural redit gettransedit to create
	  proper edit facilities for plural text also, only show skip if
	  not allowed to translate use enumerate in gettransview to make it
	  simpler in projects, handle plural forms in indexing code and
	  unquotefrompo/quotefrompo these now return dictionaries if given
	  them, containing the quoted values

2005-05-06 11:20  davidfraser

	* pagelayout.py: make sure the adminlink is properly joined

2005-05-06 10:25  davidfraser

	* translatepage.py: redid gettransedit to use gettransview if not
	  allowed to edit changed so plurals display the actual plurals
	  along with the explanation that they can't be edited reordered
	  logic in gettransview

2005-05-06 10:11  davidfraser

	* translatepage.py, html/pootle.css: gettransview - cleaning up
	  plural form construction, use TranslationHeaders for it added
	  color to the translation header

2005-05-06 09:49  davidfraser

	* translatepage.py: handle plurals in translatepage maketable - get
	  isplural from projects translations and pass to
	  getorigdiv/gettransedit/gettransview
	  getorigdiv/transview/transedit now handle plural forms
	  getorigdiv:	prints headers for the plural	note that this
	  changes the id for the raw original hidden field gettransedit:
	  plurals are simply marked as not working yet gettransview:
	  displays the plural translation with the numeric plural item
	  number.  highlightdiffs:   I'm sending trans[0], etc to transdiff
	  I don't think this is right.	  Diffs are screwy if you have
	  plurals in the file.

	  note: up till now, you need pagelayout.py revision <= 1.5 - with
	  this commit you need pagelayout.py >= 1.6

2005-05-06 09:27  davidfraser

	* translatepage.py: removed sidebar entry showing current file as
	  thats now in the title

2005-05-06 09:21  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py, pagelayout.py, translatepage.py: moved navigation
	  functions from PootlePage into PootleNavPage, adjusted classes
	  that need them added check that the languagecodes the user has
	  set for their home page are valid

2005-05-06 09:12  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py, pagelayout.py: move getbrowseurl and makelink from
	  indexpage.ProjectIndex to pagelayout.PootlePage this makes them
	  accessible in a TranslatePage as well (but possibly they should
	  be moved to a more general class)

2005-05-06 09:11  davidfraser

	* translatepage.py: until we have plurals, we should use the whole
	  of orig...

2005-05-06 08:50  davidfraser

	* translatepage.py: gettransedit patch [Dwayne Bailey]:    - allow
	  user-specified inputheight and width to start with, remove hack

	* indexpage.py: Patch from Dwayne Bailey: - consolidate statistics
	  generation with *pagestats in pagelayout - created navbar code in

	  and retired MainItem - Added TranslationHeaders for plural forms
	  - new geticon function to return the right icon for a given named
	  type - makenavbarpath creates the navbar clickable path, i've
	  tried to optimise it	 as far as possible removing redundant and

	  all together - polarizeitems creates the striped lists which are
	  now appearing averywhere - *pagestats create stats for the two
	  project and language list pages

2005-05-06 06:17  davidfraser
