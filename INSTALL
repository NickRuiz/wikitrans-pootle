INSTALLATION

1. ./manage.py syncdb

   At this step, you will be asked to create a superuser.
   This user will be the administrator for your Pootle
   installation.

2. ./manage.py initdb

   This step fills the database with initial data needed
   to run Pootle.

3. ./manage.py runserver

   You can now visit your Pootle installation at 
   http://localhost:8000. Note that the first time will
   take a few moments to load, since Pootle needs to pre-compute
   stats data for the translation files.

COMMON PROBLEMS

If you get an error such as sqlite3.OperationalError: unable to open database file, then DATABASE_NAME in pootle/settings.py is pointing at an invalid directory. The default directory name is 'dbs' - ensure that this exists.
