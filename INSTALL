Installation
------------
Pootle works perfectly directly from the source files without installation.

Extract Pootle's source code, then change directory to inside the
Pootle dir

        tar xvf Pootle-......tar.gz
        cd Pootle-.......

If you want to install Pootle into your system, run

        python setup.py install

For installation under apache, see this page:
        http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/pootle/apache
and check the notes below about manually preparing your database.


Running
-------
To run Pootle from sources, just run

        ./PootleServer

After installation with setup.py, PootleServer should also be accessible from
the installation.

If you are more familiar with Django projects, you can look into the manage.py
commands as well.

Use --help to see the other options. The defaults will generally work.

Now visit http://localhost:8000/ and begin translating.

To stop the server, press Ctrl-C.

It is not recommended to run Pootle as the root user.

Pootle can run under Apache using mod_python or mod_wsgi, but this requires
modifications to Apache's config files. Check
        http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/pootle/apache
for detailed instructions


Manual preparation
------------------

1. ./manage.py syncdb

   At this step, you will be asked to create a superuser.
   This user will be the administrator for your Pootle
   installation.

2. ./manage.py initdb

   This step fills the database with initial data needed
   to run Pootle.

3. ./manage.py refresh_stats
   Precalculate statisstics and indexes for existing translation projects.
   This step is not strictly required, but without it Pootle will feel a bit
   sluggish and slow when visiting accessing a page for the first time.

4. ./manage.py runserver

   You can now visit your Pootle installation at 
   http://localhost:8000. Note that the first time will
   take a few moments to load, since Pootle needs to pre-compute
   stats data for the translation files.


Common problems
---------------

If you get an error such as
    sqlite3.OperationalError: unable to open database file
then DATABASE_NAME in pootle/settings.py is pointing at an invalid directory.
The default directory name is 'dbs' - ensure that this exists, and is writable
for the user running Pootle.
