        <h3 class="title" id="about">About Pootle</h3>

        <p>Pootle is a web portal that allows you to translate more easily. The
        name stands for <acronym title="Gettext Portable Object">PO</acronym>-based
        Online Translation / Localization Engine, but you may need to read <a
        href="http://www.thechestnut.com/flumps.htm"
        title="http://www.thechestnut.com/flumps.htm">this</a>. Pootle is <acronym
        title="GNU General Public License">GPL</acronym> licensed Free Software, and
        you can download it and run your own copy if you like.</p>

        <p>You can also help participate in the development in many ways (you
        don&#039;t have to be able to program).</p>

        <p>The Pootle project itself is hosted at <a
        href="http://translate.sourceforge.net" class="urlextern"
        title="http://translate.sourceforge.net">http://translate.sourceforge.net</a>
        where you can find details about source code, mailing lists, etc.</p>

        <h3 class="title" id="registration">Registration</h3>

        <p>While everybody can view the files, only registered users can edit
        them and receive credit for their effort, so unless your server uses LDAP
        authentication, the first thing you should do in order to translate, is to
        register.</p>

        <p>You can register in the register page (accessible by clicking
        <code>Register</code> in the menubar) following two simple steps, providing you
        have a current e-mail address.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Fill in your desired user name, a valid e-mail account, and
            enter your password twice for verification. Then choose <code>Register</code>
            and an you will receive a message with an activation link in the e-mail address
            you have provided.</li>
            <li>When you receive the activation message by e-mail, just click
            on the activation link and your account will be activated.</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="top"><a href="#content">↑ back to top</a></p>

        <h3 class="title" id="account">Login and user settings setup</h3>

        <p>Now that you are a registered user, you can login to Pootle by
        following the <code>Login</code> link on the top menubar and filling in your
        credentials.</p>

        <p>Once you have logged in, your account&#039;s dashboard will be
        shown, which includes links to your selected languages and projects.</p>

        <p>The first time you log in, no links will be shown since you
        haven&#039;t chosen any before. You can click on the link provided to change
        your settings and select your preferred languages and projects. You can set
        more settings within the same page as well.</p>

        <p class="top"><a href="#content">↑ back to top</a></p>

        <h3 class="title" id="browsing">Browsing the files tree</h3>

        <p>Now that your dashboard is set up, you can reach the desired files
        for translation directly through the links in it.</p>

        <p>Another way to find the file you wish to translate is through the
        main page.<br/>
        The main page displays two categories - Languages and Projects.
        Choosing a language will give you the list of projects available for
        translation into this language; choosing a project will give you the list of
        languages to which it can be translated.</p>

        <p>Once you have chosen both the project and the language, you&#039;ll
        be presented with the files and directories available for translation.</p>

        <p class="top"><a href="#content">↑ back to top</a></p>

        <h3 class="title" id="translation">Online translating with Pootle</h3>

        <p>If you click on a filename it will start showing all the entries on
        the file, independently whether the entries are translated or not. This is also
        known as <code>Translate All</code>.</p>

        <p>Alternatively, if the translation for a file is not complete, you
        can click on the summary text (eg, <code>27 words need attention</code>), which
        will give you through all the untranslated or fuzzy entries on the file. This
        mode is also named as <code>Quick Translate</code>.</p>

        <p>In both cases you&#039;ll be presented with a two-column table, with
        the strings to be translated on the left, and the current translation on the
        right.</p>

        <p>The current edited entry will appear as a text box with the options
        <code>Skip</code> and <code>Suggest</code> or <code>Submit</code> below it.
        Naturally you can enter text in the text box and submit it or skip to the next
        entry.</p>

        <p>You can also directly access any of the other entries presented by
        clicking on the numbers on the left-hand side.</p>

        <p><a href="#content">↑ back to top</a></p>

        <h3 class="title" id="aids">Other aids from Pootle</h3>

        <p>Pootle&#039;s editor also helps translators by displaying <a
        href="http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/pootle/terminology_matching"
        >terminology</a> related to the entry currently being edited.</p>

        <p>Another helpful feature is the <a
        href="http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/pootle/alternative_source_language"
        >alternative source language</a>, which displays how the current entry has been
        translated into other languages.  In order for this to work, you must select
        your desired alternative source languages in you account&#039;s settings.</p>

        <p>In addition to the above, you can also download the translation
        file, work offline with your favourite editor and upload the file. For
        multi-file projects, you can download a ZIP file with all the files for a
        directory and upload the ZIP file with the translated files.</p>
