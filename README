Pootle: a web translation and translation management engine
===========================================================

How it works
------------
The concept is: a PO file is a document, so lets use PO files directly, 
rather than storing it in a database.  But we need quick access to statistics 
so we cache them in .stats files. This lets us do most checks etc in advance 
and then iterate quickly.

Requirements/Installation
-------------------------
Pootle requires the Translate Toolkit package from 
http://translate.sourceforge.net as it uses most of the other modules.

The Translate Toolkit requires Python 2.2 or higher, but Pootle itself 
probably only works with Python 2.3 or higher.  The Translate Toolkit must 
be installed properly i.e. it needs to be accessible in your Python Path. This
will normally be accomplished by installing from source:

	python setup.py install

For the web interface, Pootle requires jToolkit (http://jtoolkit.sourceforge.net/)
jToolkit can run applications either via Apache using mod_python, or standalone 
from the command line.  Pootle works best at the moment being run from the 
command line since we don't handle inter-process locking etc.  It's also 
much easier! To install jToolkit run:

	tar xvzf jToolkit-N.N.N.tar.gz
	cd jToolkit-N.N.N
	python jToolkitSetup.py install

To install Pootle itself, run

	tar xzf Pootle-N.N.N.tar.gz
	cd Pootle-N.N.N
	python pootlesetup.py install

Running
-------
To run, edit pootle.prefs and specify your languages and projects. The key detail 
here is the podir for each project.  Then from the Pootle directory run:

	python pootle.py

Use --help to see the other options.  You can tell it which prefs file to use, 
what HTML file and what port to run on (the default is 8080). The defaults will 
generally work.

Now visit http://localhost:8080/ and begin translating.

To stop, press Ctrl-C. On Windows, it will only react to the Ctrl-C after a webpage is requested.

Notes
-----
Files should be reindexed automatically.
To reindex manually, simply remove any stats files you want reindexed, or run 
	python pootle.py --refreshstats

Assignments
-----------
To assign sstrings to users, you need to create a xxx.po.assigns file in the same 
directory as xxx.po This should contain lines in the following format:

username: action: 0,2-34,36,99

where action can be 'suggest' or 'review', and the numbers refer to 0-based item 
numbers in the file.
