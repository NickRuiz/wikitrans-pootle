How it works
------------
Pootle can host a number of translation projects for a number of languages.  It
allows a team to manage their files, permissions, projects, and also allows for
translation on-line.  Files can be downloaded for offline translation and later
uploaded again.

Pootle tries to lower the barrier of entry,  but also provides tools  to enable
teams to work towards higher quality while welcoming newcomers.

Requirements
------------
Pootle usually requires the latest Translate Toolkit package:
http://translate.sourceforge.net/
Note all the optional dependencies of the Translate Toolkit for optimal
performance and functionality in Pootle.

Python version 2.4 or later is required.

Pootle requires Django (at least version 1.0)
(http://www.djangoproject.com/)
Django applications can run under Apache using mod_python or mod_wsgi,
but they're also bundled with a standalone webserver that can be run
from the command line.  Pootle works equally well on all Django
deployment scenarios, standalone server is the easiest to set up and
get running.

To run Pootle you need to have Django 1.0 installed properly

       tar xzvf Django-1.0.2-final.tar.gz
       cd Django-1.0.2-final
       sudo python setup.py install

you can also install Django using easy_install

       easy_install django

The commandline utilities "zip" and "unzip" can speed up handling of ZIP files.
For integration with a version control system, the relevant version control
command line client must be installed and accessible from the PATH.

Installation of an indexing engine (PyLucene or Xapian) is optional, but helps
to speed up searching. Note that Xapian is incompatible with Apache, and
Pootle will not enable Xapian indexing if running under mod_python or mod_wsgi.


Installing and running
----------------------
Check the INSTALL file.


Bug Reporting/Feature requests
------------------------------
You can always report bugs or feature requests on the mailing list but because
of the increase in users and the fact that bug reports do go missing it is
probably best to place your bug report in Bugzilla: http://bugs.locamotion.org/

If you have a traceback or a patch then please include it. Also please be quite
specific about how the bug occured and what you expected to happen.

If this is a feature request then try to be specific about how you think this
feature should work.

Notes
-----
Files should be reindexed automatically. To ensure that all statistics and
indices are up to date for the current projects and languages, run
        PootleServer --refreshstats

Assignments
-----------
Goals and assignments don't work at the moment, but should be re-instated soon.
