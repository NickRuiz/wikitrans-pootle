h1. Welcome to the WikiTrans-Pootle wiki!

*WikiTrans* is an open-source machine translation project that is intended for use with the Wikipedia 
community. Using Pootle as a platform, users are able to request translations of Wikipedia articles 
into various languages. The user community can review and post-edit machine translations before 
submitting the new article to Wikipedia. Eventually, these post-edits will be used to update the MT 
systems.
