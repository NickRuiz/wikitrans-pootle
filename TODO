current tasks:
  upload submissions as po file / zip
  assigning stuff to people (package + email too)
  - upload completed work (by maintainer)
  - what has been returned, what hasn't
  - ability to send work to people
  - let maintainer add people manually
  localize pootle
  - create po files
  - set language on login (and detect languages from browser)
  priorities (directory/file order)
  process (administrators/translators/reviewers)
  locking
  allow search to display only items related to search (no context)
  add ability to email bug report

requirements for translatathon:
  relate assignments to rights (people can only translate what they're assigned)
   - both translation and review
  attribution (based on login)
    ? where to put it
    - last translator
    - comment with everyone at top of po file
    - comment in suggestion
  translation review cycle
    - comment to explain rejection
  highlight spaces in original so you can see what is a space

other:
  add ability to mark/unmark things as fuzzy
  move the sidebar to be like distributed proofreaders (at the top, small)
  test with apache multiprocess
  store a history file
  maybe have a separate file to track who translated each string
  display results of checks for each string on submission
  handle language subtypes (regions)
  handle project versions
  have clickable characters to add for a language (mostly useful for diacritics)
  a reviewer can mark as string as fuzzy but not provide a translation (in
    order to browse and fixup things like af KDE.
  integrate with KBabel/POEdit
  allow XLIFF version of files to be uploaded
  show KDE and other PO comments in some uncluttered but accesible way
  create .qm (compiled Qt .ts files).  See lrelease which is GPL'd for Qt .qm files
  create XPI files automatically when updates are made
  Add X-Poedit style tags in the header when you download so that people using
    this PO editor don't have to configure everything
  stats:
    percentage change.  So you can see if a language/project is active or not.
  if there is only one .PO firl for a project then merge the header bar and the
    PO file bar to make it less clutered and more logical.
  goto a specific message.  Maybe a better thing to have a bar graph showing
    what bits aren't translated and jump straight to that.
  localisation: create a fallback mechanism so you can set a number of
    languages: Bambara, French then default to English.
  three column translation: English, Other language, Destination Language.  So
    that a French speaker can translate into Bambarra with little English

bugs:
  currently project codes cannot have a dash "-" in them eg kde-i18n.  Either
    we should allow or warn when starting pootle. (check, should be fixed)
  header entries get jumbled when we update them.  Technically not an issue but
    creates quite a lot of CVS noise
  "no group" entry shows 0 stats
  items inside the current group should have "group=" in link so clicking "remove" on assignment doesn't jump out of group

assignment:
  create user groups, assign to a group

feedback from Durban translatathon:
  regenerate Pootle PO files on web
  autocreate POT files when packaging
  automatic tips for things like accelerators
  tutorial PO file

new:
  add equivalent management of pot files
    - rights
    - uploading, updating from CVS etc
    ? able to have multiple pot repositories
  new rights model:
    maintainer of a whole project (all languages)
    global goals for all languages
    admins for a whole language - accept translators etc
    let people "take" a file (self-assign) if not being managed
  let setting up project be totally automatic...

suggestions from list:
  search and replace across a whole file
  translator comments / tagging of strings
  translation of language names (do the whole iso codes list)
  drop-down list for languages (improve selection)
  simple way to see the plural definition for a language
  validate plurals against KBabel/msginit entries
