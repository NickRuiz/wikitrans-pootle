  #
  #   fullname = "Afrikaans"
  # The fullname of the language, also from ISO639 but can be the name of the
  # language in your language not necessarily in English. When the iso-codes
  # package is installed, translated language names can be provided to 
  # correspond to the interface language. The exact English names used in the 
  # iso-codes package has to be used for translation to be successful. The 
  # language name can also contain a country name in brackets at the back, in 
  # which case a translation for the country name will similarly be attempted 
  # using the iso-codes package. For example:
  #   fullname = "Portuguese (Brazil)"

  # This defines the number of plural forms for the language.  You need this in
