	  projects can use when it does changes internally without a
	  session

2005-04-11 17:41  davidfraser

	* translatepage.py: when actually submitting translations, we
	  should use pofilename that was supplied in the argdict for the
	  submission, not self.pofilename

2005-04-11 16:41  davidfraser

	* translatepage.py: suggestions seem to be normal strings
	  sometimes, this should fix it till we find out why

2005-04-11 16:26  davidfraser

	* translatepage.py: only add links to current folder, stats if
	  self.pofilename is not None (when a search is finished / returns
	  no items, self.pofilename is None)

2005-04-07 16:54  davidfraser

	* pootlefile.py, projects.py: reset the encoding when rereading the
	  pofile (otherwise it won't decode properly!) only freshen the
	  newpofile on versioncontrol update, it should be read by the
	  constructor

2005-04-07 14:53  davidfraser

	  of goals, needs more work

2005-04-05 22:47  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py: renamed setgoal to editgoal

2005-04-05 22:45  davidfraser

	  directories exclusively to goals also fixed bnad syntax (calling
	  list) note that this is not aware of files being contained inside
	  directories yet

2005-04-05 22:36  davidfraser

	* projects.py, indexpage.py: changed linksrequired for goal items
	  renamed methods, restructured so files are only accessed in
	  getgoalfiles make sure goalfiles are not empty string fixed using
	  username instead of session

2005-04-05 19:28  dwaynebailey

	* indexpage.py: "Quick Translate" is now always visible but
	  disabled if there are no items to translate.	Should probably be
	  greyed out instead of just not have a link.

	  As a policy I think we need to ensure that: 1) You only see
	  things that you are allowed to see with your rights 2) Things do
	  not disappear they just get disabled.

2005-04-05 17:22  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py, projects.py: fixed up funny empty items in
	  goalfiles list added ability to show items in goal by clicking on
	  goal title

	  functionality (adding files to a goal, getting a specific goal,
	  etc) fixed setting the attribute to "goalname" instead of
	  goalname

2005-04-05 14:19  davidfraser

	* pagelayout.py: was only initializing adminlink if
	  session.issiteadmin() or not session.isopen, changed to
	  initialize correctly

2005-04-05 12:31  davidfraser

	* translatepage.py: wrong variable name

2005-04-04 10:34  dwaynebailey

	* indexpage.py: You should only be able to remove assigns if you
	  actaully have the rights to assign them in the first place.

	* pootlefile.py: updated doc string

2005-04-02 12:40  davidfraser

	* potree.py: do something with the new translationproject created,
	  and don't store getpodir result when just using it for a check

2005-04-02 12:38  davidfraser

	* pootle.py, potree.py, projects.py: moved POTree into its own new
	  module, potree

2005-04-02 11:57  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py, pootlefile.py, projects.py, translatepage.py: moved
	  pootlefile class into its own new file, and adjusted projects etc
	  also cleaned up links in indexpage

2005-04-02 11:35  davidfraser

	* adminpages.py, indexpage.py, pootle.py, users.py: moved various
	  classes from indexpage into new module adminpages, and
	  UserOptions into users

2005-04-01 23:12  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py: removed extraneous function call

2005-04-01 17:23  davidfraser

	* projects.py, indexpage.py, pootle.py, translatepage.py: removed
	  the terrible concept known as 'TranslationSession' implement
	  rights checking in the TranslationProject added "assign" and
	  "admin" rights

2005-04-01 16:45  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py, projects.py: made a method on the project that gets
	  the rights and localized names available for that project (moved
	  from indexpage)

2005-04-01 16:28  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py, pootle.py, projects.py: implented permissions
	  system, with ability for administrator to change permissions each
	  translation project now has a prefs file
	  (pootle-projectcode-languagecode.prefs in the po directory) this
	  has a rights attribute, which stores default rights, nobody
	  rights, and rights for individual users the administrator can go
	  to /language/project/admin.html to edit the rights

2005-04-01 13:49  davidfraser

	* projects.py, translatepage.py: if a entry is accessed in
	  project.pofiles and it is not there, but the file exists, then
	  update the index (this can happen if the timecache expires for
	  example) handle files being added / removed more robustly as well
	  also improved logic for setting and using pofilename in
	  translatepage (was fairly inconsistent)  - receivetranslations
	  shouldn't set self.pofilename  - also we now pick up pofilename
	  from dirfilter if explicitly a PO file

2005-03-31 21:02  dwaynebailey

	* pootle.prefs, translatepage.py: If you define "specialchars" in a
	  language preferences then those characters will be displayed with
	  the input widget allowing users to copy and paste these
	  characters into the translation.  Usefull if you do not have a
	  keyboard configured with these characters.

2005-03-31 20:15  dwaynebailey

	* translatepage.py: Make sure that end never points to a negative
	  item.  This happens when the number of items is less than
	  pagesize.  We disable the link in this case but just fixing this
	  cause we can and it will stop it biting us later.

2005-03-31 19:02  dwaynebailey

	* TODO: More buglets

2005-03-31 11:54  davidfraser

	  are now disabled if you are at the beginning or end of the
	  file.

2005-03-31 00:41  dwaynebailey

	* translatepage.py: Make the viewmode navigation more intuative and
	  user friendly: - Added Start and End links - Next 10 and Previous
	  10 do not disappear but are disabled if you are at the   start or
	  end of the file (confusing when they disappear)

2005-03-30 23:04  dwaynebailey

	* indexpage.py: Move Zip of folder up to the navbar.  Remove the
	  addnavlink method as we have no more need for this.

2005-03-30 19:59  dwaynebailey

	* TODO: Some interesting new TODO items

2005-03-30 17:47  davidfraser

	* versioncontrol.py: backup the file first and restore or remove it
	  afterwards for cvs update this avoids having lots of
	  .#filename.rev files left around

2005-03-30 17:24  davidfraser

	* projects.py: don't use sources to match items as thats a nice
	  idea for Mozilla/OpenOffice which use IDs as sources but a
	  horrible idea for everything else

2005-03-30 17:13  davidfraser

	* projects.py, versioncontrol.py: updated CVS/svn update method so
	  that it now actually checks out the new version from CVS, to
	  update the record of which version is current.  refactored
	  mergefile and created new matchitems method which mathces up
	  poitems from two files and returns them use the new matchitems to
	  extract current changes (equivalent to a cvs diff) and then merge
	  those with the new file (equivalent to a cvs patch) also moved
	  local function mergeitem to be a method, made it not try to find
	  headers check properly for full name and email address when doing
	  Last_Translator in versioncontrol, created helper shellescape and
	  added update methods as well as introspecting what version a file
	  is when getting a clean copy (BASE doesn't work here...)

2005-03-30 13:47  davidfraser

	* TODO, translatepage.py: added a copy button

2005-03-30 11:48  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py, projects.py, versioncontrol.py: added simple
	  versioncontrol module (CVS method from
	  http://software.cnx.rice.edu/downloads/python/pycvs/) and added
	  initial implementation for merging with latest CVS/.svn version -
	  this runs but what it actually *does* hasn't been tested also a
	  few cleanups in projects.py

2005-03-30 00:29  dwaynebailey

	* translatepage.py: Make translation column headers translatable

2005-03-29 22:06  dwaynebailey

	* translatepage.py: There are always 7 items on a translatable page
	  even if you are starting at the beginning.

2005-03-29 19:51  dwaynebailey

	* users.py: Add some value catches for email., password and full
	  name to ensure that the default example values are not used.

2005-03-29 18:53  dwaynebailey

	* users.py: Correcting some confusing or incorrect wording in user
	  creation

2005-03-29 16:35  dwaynebailey

	* indexpage.py: Do not display the __dummy__ user Use getattr
	  function for getting email addresses as it can cope when there is
	  no value set.

2005-03-29 16:32  dwaynebailey

	* pagelayout.py: Add an "Admin" quicklink if the user is a
	  siteadmin.

2005-03-28 15:09  dwaynebailey

	* projects.py: The "Last-Translator" header field is now updated
	  during normal translation.  No update is performed for a
	  suggestion but probably should be done - but who do we credit the
	  suggestor or the approver?

2005-03-28 09:56  dwaynebailey

	* indexpage.py: Assignments now appear in alphabetical order

2005-03-27 20:40  dwaynebailey

	* indexpage.py: "Show Checks" is not sorted alphabetically.  had to
	  eliminate yield, iteritem and others so that we can sort the
	  dictionary keys.  This should allow us to alternatively sort
	  these lists by the values also.

2005-03-27 14:01  dwaynebailey

	* indexpage.py, pagelayout.py, pootle.py, translatepage.py: When a
	  user logs in they will be redirected to the folder that they were
	  browsing when they decided to login.

	  TODO currently if they are viewing a file they will be returned
	  to the folder that they started the view from they will not be
	  returned to the place were they were viewing.

2005-03-24 18:03  davidfraser

	* translatepage.py: since PO files now handle encodings, all the
	  strings are unicode when grepping, so the searchtext should be
	  unicode too...

2005-03-24 16:50  dwaynebailey

	* pagelayout.py: Quick link to users home page

2005-03-24 15:32  dwaynebailey

	* indexpage.py: Remove "project root" from the sidebar and
	  integrate it into the top navbar

2005-03-24 14:34  dwaynebailey

	* indexpage.py: No need for "current folder" and "parent folder" on
	  indepage as these are know accesibale throught the top directory
	  navigation bar.

2005-03-24 14:25  dwaynebailey

	* indexpage.py: Make the title base links browsable so that you can
	  jump straight back to anywhere in the heirachy.

	  info.
	  http://mail.python.org/pipermail/patches/2003-July/012899.html

2005-03-18 14:45  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py, projects.py: allow updating from templates from
	  project admin page renamed "create" to "converttemplates" which
	  is more accurate fixed it so it uses the new uploadpofile removed
	  debug print statement

2005-03-18 14:34  davidfraser

	* projects.py: merged addnewpofile and mergepofile into
	  uploadpofile fixed variable name in mergeitems

2005-03-18 14:27  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py, projects.py: added merging ability via mergefile
	  currently this copies translations if the existing translation is
	  blank, adds new strings (not in old file), and makes any changed
	  strings suggestions factored out getuploadpath from addnewpofile,
	  and added equivalent mergepofile these should probably both be
	  merged down to uploadpofile also use mergepofile from create,
	  though this needs development

2005-03-18 13:24  dwaynebailey

	* indexpage.py, pootle.py, projects.py: Only make MO files
	  available to logged in users.

2005-03-18 13:08  davidfraser

	* TODO: have fixed accepting/rejecting suggestions

2005-03-18 13:00  davidfraser

	* projects.py: remove printout of track messages made
	  deletesuggestion actually find the relevant suggestion for the
	  correct item and delete that rather than just using suggitem as
	  an index into the whole pending file this still needs
	  improvements, but at least its not always wrong now

2005-03-18 12:38  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py: refactored actions that can take place on IndexPage
	  into handleactions ensure that actions delete their arguments
	  from self.argdict, so they aren't placed into other links by
	  makelinks other argument handling moved to after handleactions

2005-03-16 12:38  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py: added a localizable page title that includes the
	  projectname and the languagename

	  personal details

2005-03-13 11:21  dwaynebailey

	  Reordered the fields into something more logical.

2005-03-11 17:38  dwaynebailey

	* pootle.prefs: Example setup for MO file generation

2005-03-11 17:32  dwaynebailey

	* indexpage.py, pootle.py, projects.py: Allow download of MO files,
	  compiled on the fly from the PO file.

	  Admin users can specify if a project creates MO files.  Projects
	  like OpenOffice.org, Mozilla, etc do not need MO file ever.

	  Correct HTTP content header to indicate correct encoding for CSV
	  and PO files (NOTE: this might cause a problem if the underlying
	  PO file is not UTF-8 encoded)

2005-03-11 17:22  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py, projects.py: added ability to handle uploading zip
	  files (needs refinement) moved checking of upload file existence
	  from indexpage to projects use cStringIO rather than StringIO

2005-03-11 16:58  davidfraser

	* projects.py: made hasgnufiles recurse subdirectories, and also

	* translatepage.py: extract the stopped message directly rather
	  than using str() as the StopIteration won't handle unicode

	  giving the same problem...)

2005-03-10 16:37  davidfraser

	* pootle.py, translatepage.py: instead of returning to the

	  management.  currently this limits any changes to logged-in
	  users. it only works by disabling links, more work is needed

2004-12-09 12:08  dwaynebailey

	* TODO: Add wish for download of compiled PO and Qt .ts files

2004-12-08 11:14  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py: fixed main link which should always point to the
	  current folder

2004-12-08 11:10  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py, pagelayout.py: polarity was done before sort, fixed
	  it so its easy to set on the item and do it after the sort

2004-12-07 16:58  davidfraser

	* html/images/pootle.jpg: hand-drawn cartoon

2004-12-07 16:53  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py, pagelayout.py, html/pootle.css: added switching
	  background color for alternating item rows

2004-12-07 16:38  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py: made headings always link to item so we don't need
	  "Browse/View" added getbrowseurl function to make that easier
	  added option to say which links are required from getactionlinks
	  leave out checks by default, only show in heading changed checks
	  to show/hide checks based on current value fixed showchecks
	  detection (work if it comes in as unicode)

2004-12-07 16:21  davidfraser

	* html/pootle.css: added icon style (floating)

2004-12-07 16:16  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py, pagelayout.py: added some icons, and sorted
	  directories and files added an Icon class

2004-12-06 23:03  davidfraser

	* projects.py, translatepage.py: record who suggested a suggestion
	  in the msgid comment, look it up when displaying it later. fairly
	  crude

2004-12-06 22:46  davidfraser

	* README, projects.py: keep track of our latest pomtime in
	  pootlefile so we re-read the file if it changes we use
	  self.pomtime to reflect whether we have parsed the file as well
	  (note: this needs to be done with care so that it is only set
	  after parsing and classification and stats are done) new method
	  pofreshen can be used to make sure the file is parsed and up to
	  date updated the README to reflect the fact that reindexing is
	  now automatic also added a note about how to do assignments

2004-12-06 22:15  davidfraser

	* translatepage.py: set search.assignedaction based on the current
	  mode (search for things the user has been assigned to
	  review/suggest)

2004-12-06 22:09  davidfraser

	* projects.py, translatepage.py: refactored pofilename searching
	  into separate method matchessearch for each pofilename added
	  assignment searching to pofilename searching replaced
	  search.assigncondition with search.assignedto and
	  search.assignedaction improved pootlefile.iteritems to handle
	  either/both search.assign attributes fixed up docstrings to
	  reflect new search parameter updated translatepage to use the new
	  Search syntax

2004-12-06 21:33  davidfraser

	* projects.py, translatepage.py: rearranged all the search
	  parameters into a single object to make it easier to pass them
	  around

2004-12-06 20:13  davidfraser

	* translatepage.py: redid editlinks to float at the top right of
	  the cell ; in this way they don't appear "out the box"

2004-12-06 11:05  davidfraser

	* pootle.py: was sending the submitted password to the original
	  email address which was nuts we don't have the actual password,
	  only the md5sum, but send it anyway :-)

2004-12-06 10:46  davidfraser

	* projects.py, translatepage.py: added the ability to search within
	  a file based on assign conditions (file searches still need this)
	  added "suggest" assignment search when logged in

2004-12-05 12:17  davidfraser

	* projects.py: added code for handling ".assigns" files which store
	  who has been assigned what ...

2004-12-05 11:45  davidfraser

	* projects.py: added caching for pending files (if file is updated
	  it will be re-read) store pending file time in stats file, since
	  it depends on that too...  added method to reclassify all items'
	  suggestion status moved project.iterpoitems to pofile.iteritems,
	  call getstats to update them if required

2004-12-05 10:55  davidfraser

	* projects.py: getmodtime needs absolute, not relative filename

2004-12-05 10:53  davidfraser

	* projects.py: made getmodtime a function that takes a filename so
	  it is useful for files other than pofile.filename

2004-12-05 10:43  davidfraser

	* projects.py, translatepage.py: removed code storing lastitem,
	  pofilename on session (since they're stored in the browser state
	  anyway)

2004-12-05 10:04  davidfraser

	* projects.py: cache the mtime of the stats file as well so if it
	  is changed it will be re-read automatically this should enable
	  updating the stats separately to the web server

2004-12-05 09:50  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py: mainstats was passing actual directory rather than
	  relative one ("") to getitemstats so check links were wrong

2004-12-05 09:42  davidfraser

	* projects.py: fixed up logic for when to read stats, handling
	  missing stats files save stats after reclassifying elements
	  removed translationproject's stats cache, renamed initstatscache
	  to initpootlefiles

2004-12-05 09:22  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py: blank dirfilter should be None so the logic works
	  right

2004-12-04 22:48  davidfraser

	* projects.py: major refactor of TranslationProject so most of the
	  POfile-specific stuff gets handled in pootlefile, derived from
	  pofile bugs remain (it will forget about all your strings) but
	  once they're fixed it'll be lekka :-)

2004-12-04 22:34  davidfraser

	* translatepage.py, html/pootle.css: made the current editable row
	  highlighted in light gray (found this in the prototype, looks
	  leet)

2004-12-03 23:37  davidfraser

	* TODO, projects.py: added basic support for GNU-style
	  project/languagecode.po this has made the code too complex,
	  hopefully can be simplified

2004-12-03 23:17  davidfraser

	* pootle.py: remember email address fixed emailing (needs message
	  to be a proper mail message)

2004-12-03 23:05  davidfraser

	* pootle.prefs: set baseurl to / which should work in most cases
	  added default smtpserver of localhost (for registration emails
	  etc)

2004-12-03 23:05  davidfraser

	* pootle.py: added basic system for registration and activation
	  changed to allow user to specify password added minimum password
	  length of 6 improved operation in frozen conditions (e.g. py2exe)
	  by setting directory names properly

2004-12-03 22:29  dwaynebailey

	* TODO: More things to do

	  button for suggestions to last suggdiv

2004-12-03 21:40  davidfraser

	* projects.py: refactored method to get filenames so its actually
	  done by potree, not the TranslationProject this should make it
	  easier to handle the GNU-style layout fixed docstring for
	  getpodir

2004-12-03 21:12  davidfraser

	* TODO: moved translatathon requirements added requirement for
	  GNU-style ar.po filenames

2004-12-03 17:43  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py: added stats for the main item (if it's not a po
	  file, in which case you can see them under the po file) corrected
	  links for check names (were missing a &)

2004-12-03 16:26  dwaynebailey

	* TODO: More TODO items

2004-12-03 12:46  davidfraser

2004-12-02 22:46  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py, pagelayout.py, html/pootle.css: made the MainItem
	  stand out ...  link directory titles to Browse that directory
	  handle dirfilter being None intelligently

2004-12-02 22:29  davidfraser

	* TODO, indexpage.py, html/pootle.css: don't show actionlinks if
	  dirfilter is a po file, and put them in a standard Item reordered
	  code to make it more logical, put navlinks into separate function
	  adjusted stylesheet so margin is below whole item, not only if it
	  has statistics

2004-12-02 21:55  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py: refactored main action links (at top of page) to
	  use getactionlinks too factored out new method getchilditems
	  rather than having this in the constructor checkslink was never
	  included, also handle basename == "" in getactionlinks

2004-12-02 21:45  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py: refactored ProjectIndex to share more code between
	  diritem and fileitem

2004-12-02 21:12  davidfraser

	* translatepage.py: rearranged breaks in review mode, added skip
	  button

2004-11-29 15:01  davidfraser

	* translatepage.py: added basic diffs using difflib (tries to
	  highlight in yellow what has changed) (handles multiple
	  suggestions in a semi-intelligent way) added breaks between lines
	  in review...

2004-11-27 23:05  davidfraser

	* translatepage.py: added hidden widget for suggestion text so we
	  know what it is when processing the form

2004-11-27 18:03  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py, pootle.py, projects.py: added a project page for
	  each project that lists the valid languages added a method to
	  potree that lets you get the languagecodes for a specific project

2004-11-27 17:31  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py, pootle.prefs, projects.py: changed the structure of
	  pootle.prefs so instead of having to define every project under
	  every language, you define:  projects, in its own top-level tree
	  languages, in its own top-level tree	directories, using
	  "$project" and "$language" to denote project	  (you can either
	  just define a directorysearch as a string, or have a node which
	  defines the project / language and a directory - see the
	  examples) added links to projects as well (still need to define
	  index for them...)

2004-11-27 16:53  davidfraser

	* pagelayout.py: use SeparatedList for linking ActionLinks together

2004-11-27 16:36  davidfraser

	* README, __init__.py, pootle.prefs, pootle.py, server.py: renamed
	  server.py to pootle.py so it's a more sensible thing to run...

	  not just submits made a tooltip on the original text showing the
	  classes it belongs to...

2004-11-23 22:40  davidfraser

	* projects.py, translatepage.py: require the suggestion item number
	  for acceptsuggestion and rejectsuggestion, and remove from the
	  pending file this is fairly brutal and no checks are done rename
	  TranslatePage.translationsession to .session to save long names
	  :-)

2004-11-23 22:36  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py: added reviewlink to main toolbar fixed up review
	  URLs to include the basename properly

2004-11-23 22:34  davidfraser

	* translatepage.py: refactored receivetranslations so it can handle
	  multiple actions - skip, submit, accept, reject this works by
	  having an id (item or item.suggid) in each button which will only
	  be received if the item is clicked moved call to gettranslations
	  to inside maketable this allows us to call getsuggestions from
	  there too to handle the review process refactored getorigcell /
	  gettranscell to only fetch the div specialized gettrans into
	  gettransedit/review/view replaced all row-based ids with absolute

	  currently just prints out suggestions to command line

2004-11-20 17:34  davidfraser

	  pofilename

2004-11-20 17:27  davidfraser

	  pending files

	  to reclassify that item, not all the elements in the pofile

2004-11-17 10:33  davidfraser

	* projects.py: refactored classifyelements to use classifyelement
	  for each element

2004-11-17 10:16  davidfraser

	* projects.py: refactored classification code into classifyelements
	  method reclassify elements after save...

2004-11-17 08:54  davidfraser

	* html/pootle.css: float the translation text so it lines up better
	  with the action

2004-11-16 23:08  davidfraser

	  when you are in a .po file they still point to the current folder

2004-11-16 23:00  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py: made quick translate only appear if there are
	  untranslated (or fuzzy) strings

2004-11-16 22:52  davidfraser

	* pagelayout.py, translatepage.py, html/pootle.css,
	  html/js/autoexpand.js: tried to make edit links floatable this is

2004-11-13 17:53  davidfraser

	* TODO, pootle.prefs, projects.py, server.py: beefened up

	  searchbox construction into pagelayout added searchbox to index
	  pages updated TODO

2004-11-13 16:55  davidfraser

	* TODO, projects.py, translatepage.py: TranslationSession seems to
	  be fading away ... easier to do direct through the project use
	  project's searchpoitems rather than getnextitems from session,
	  remember pofilename and last item for page added basic search
	  using pogrep, to searchpoitems, and added text book to
	  translation page for it

2004-11-13 16:30  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py, pagelayout.py, html/pootle.css: made special class
	  for action links so we can separate them out a bit...  changed

	  refactoring, got viewing / browsing working readonably got rid of
	  getitemsbefore / getitemsafter, replaced with getitems move
	  translationsession.getitem to translationproject where it makes
	  more sense separated out the item finding in gettranslations to
	  finditem, save it in self.item

2004-11-13 15:32  davidfraser

	* projects.py, translatepage.py: fixed up page links with the help
	  of a getpofilelen method

2004-11-13 15:29  davidfraser

	  browse through 10 at a time with links to previous / next

2004-11-13 15:05  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py, server.py, translatepage.py: added code to catch
	  when a set of search items is finished and display a message The
	  message could probably be clearer but at least it works out if no
	  items matched at all...

2004-11-13 14:40  davidfraser

	* projects.py: refactored searching methods to create iterators
	  makes it a lot more logical and coherent, and allows us to catch
	  StopIteration exceptions elsewhere...

2004-11-13 14:12  davidfraser

	* projects.py: rename translationproject -> project, getlanguage ->
	  getlanguageprefs for clarity

2004-11-13 14:07  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py, projects.py, server.py, translatepage.py: don't
	  make language and project prefs accessible through POTree -

	  project in indexpage, server restore showing full names for
	  language, project where needed

2004-11-13 13:21  davidfraser

	* projects.py, translatepage.py: made the TranslationProject use
	  the potree to find its podir and other attributes added getpodir

	  translatepage.py

2004-11-13 13:17  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py, projects.py, server.py, translatepage.py: finished
	  up making sure we don't use the language and project prefnodes
	  anywhere these are basically only used to get full names for
	  languages/projects so provided functions to get those

2004-11-13 13:00  davidfraser

	* translatepage.py: never renamed project, subproject to language,
	  project...

2004-11-13 12:56  davidfraser

	  using prefnodes directly removed unused cachetables parameter

2004-11-13 12:48  davidfraser

	* projects.py, server.py: filled out iterating methods in POTree

2004-11-13 12:37  davidfraser

	* projects.py, server.py: added default options for startup added

2004-11-10 09:13  davidfraser

	* projects.py, translatepage.py: did some simplification of
	  translation session, factored out getitem method made argdict a
	  member of TranslatePage, to simplify access added Edit link for
	  each item that lets you go straight to edit that item

2004-11-10 08:53  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py, projects.py, server.py: pass argdict in to
	  ProjectIndex, use that for showchecks rather than a special
	  variable use showchecks parameter rather than checks.html to
	  determine checking allow ProjectIndex to work on a single file
	  added browse and checks links per file allow projects code to
	  handle individual po files

2004-11-10 08:30  davidfraser

	* TODO, indexpage.py, projects.py, translatepage.py: instead of
	  translate page defaulting to quick translate, pass fuzzy and
	  blank as parameters similarly projects code doesn't default to
	  fuzzy & blank, it defaults to matchnames=[] which allows
	  everything DONE: renamed start translate

2004-11-10 08:19  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py: changed "Start Translating" to "Quick Translate"
	  Don't show the name of the file everywhere for PO files

	  pages

2004-10-25 11:58  davidfraser

	  lastitem on the TranslationSession this should make apache
	  multi-process servers pass state between processes

2004-10-25 11:46  davidfraser

	* translatepage.py: jToolkit has problems with non-unicode in the
	  TextArea ; manually decoding to unicode for now

2004-10-25 11:08  davidfraser

2004-10-25 10:57  davidfraser

	* pagelayout.py, server.py: added spearch url for login page which
	  redirects back to the index if logged in (this is because the

	* server.py: added an OptionalLoginAppServer that makes login

	  otherwise it'll never match

2004-10-25 09:53  davidfraser

	* projects.py: took out __init__ loop through self.pofiles (should
	  have been self.pofilename) as it would have been too expensive
	  but it wasn't doing anything as self.pofiles was empty moved
	  pofile.classify construction to getpofile as we always need the
	  classifications available

2004-10-23 20:26  davidfraser

	* projects.py: use matchnames for searching for next item, to make
	  it superfast :-)

2004-10-23 20:09  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py, projects.py, translatepage.py: replaced translated,
	  total with named stats in a dictionary also keep in each pofile a
	  classify member that keeps named lists of elements matching
	  fuzzy, blank, etc this should be useful in optimizing searches
	  added more info on blank, fuzzy to the sidebar of the translation
	  page

2004-10-23 19:47  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py, projects.py, translatepage.py: more detailed

	  members) rearranged test for what is translated

2004-10-23 19:26  davidfraser

	* projects.py: separated out receivetranslation so the actual
	  changes are done from the TranslationProject made new savefile
	  function which saves the pofile to disk   currently saving after
	  each change which is not ideal added doc strings

2004-10-23 19:19  davidfraser

	* projects.py: added findnextitem which searches and filters
	  options through a function this can be slow if you do what it
	  does at the moment and searches for blank msgstrs...	we should
	  use the stats to filter out files automatically...

2004-10-23 19:08  davidfraser

	* projects.py: moved logic about moving to next item from session
	  into project

2004-10-23 14:57  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py, projects.py, translatepage.py: created new class
	  TranslationSession which represents a users work on a project use
	  this to keep track of current po file, item rather than doing it
	  globally in the project added the pofilename as a hidden field so
	  we know what item is being translated exactly store translatable
	  elements in pofile.transelements for each pofile to make indexing
	  easier rather than returning items before and after with the
	  translatable item, query for them separately also changed
	  projects.getproject to only take the subproject config item

2004-10-23 13:58  davidfraser

	* projects.py: added call to initstatscache so it is actually used
	  :-) and make sure the right filenames etc are passed so that it
	  actually reads the files...

2004-10-23 13:54  davidfraser

	* projects.py: added primitive means of caching statistics in
	  .stats files with timestamps

2004-10-23 13:43  davidfraser

	* indexpage.py, projects.py, translatepage.py: read all pofiles in
	  when TranslationProject is constructed added calculation and
	  display of statistics ; this is currently very slow! renamed
	  projects.getiterator to getproject

2004-10-23 13:15  davidfraser

	* projects.py: added code to iterate through all the files in a
	  directory tree rather than just one pofile this changes the pref
	  name to podir fixed up getiterator to not use self everywhere...

2004-10-23 12:57  davidfraser

	* projects.py, translatepage.py: moved TranslationIterator code
	  into separate projects module, from whence it will be
	  transmogrified

	  offset equal to the item in the file

2004-10-22 11:14  davidfraser

	* translatepage.py: removed dummytranslations, now uses
	  subproject.pofile to get translations from also fixed up some row
	  calculation problems

2004-10-22 10:51  davidfraser

	* __init__.py, indexpage.py, pagelayout.py, server.py,
	  translatepage.py: added initial pootle implementation (with
	  random dummy bork translations)
