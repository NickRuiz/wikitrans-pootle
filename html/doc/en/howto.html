      <h3 class="title" id="registration">Registration</h3>

      <div class="info">
        Usually everybody can view the files, and only registered users
        can edit them and receive credit for their effort, so the
        first thing you should do in order to translate is to
        register.<br>
        You can register following two simple steps, providing you
        have a current email address:<br>
        1. Fill in your preferred username, password and a
        valid e-mail address, choose "Register" and an
        activation code will be sent to the e-mail address you've
        provided.<br>
        2. When you receive the confirmation e-mail, click on the activation
        link in the e-mail to activate your Pootle account.<br>

      <h3 class="title" id="account">Login and Account Setup</h3>

      <div class="info">
        Now that you are a registered user, login to Pootle.<br>
        Once you have logged in, you will be presented with your
        User Page, which includes links to your selected languages
        and projects. Edit your preferences there.<br>

      <h3 class="title" id="browsing">Browsing the Files Tree</h3>

      <div class="info">
        Now that your User Page is set up, you can reach the
        desired files for translation directly through the links in
        it.<br>
        Another way to find the file you wish to translate is
        from the main page.<br>
        The main page displays two categories - Languages and
        Projects. Choosing a language will give you the list of
        projects available for translation into this language;
        choosing a project will give you the list of languages to
        which it can be translated.<br>
        Once you have chosen both the project and the language,
        you'll be presented with the files available for
        translation.<br>

      <h3 class="title" id="translation">Online translating with
      Pootle</h3>

      <div class="info">
        Each file available for translation can be accessible in
        two ways - "Quick Translate" will show only the entries
        needing attention, while "Translate All" will show all
        the entries in the file, translated or not. In both cases
        you'll be presented with a two-column table, with the
        strings to be translated on the left, and the current
        translation on the right.<br>
        The current edited entry will appear as of a text box with
        the options "Skip" and "Submit" below it. Naturally you can
        enter text in the text box and submit it or skip to the
        next entry.<br>
        You can also directly access any of the other entries
        presented by clicking the link next to the entry.<br>

      <h3 class="title" id="aids">Other aids from Pootle</h3>

      <div class="info">
        You can also download the files to translate offline. The
        upload form allows you to upload the files later.<br>
        You should also review the quality checks and suggestions
        by other team members.<br>
