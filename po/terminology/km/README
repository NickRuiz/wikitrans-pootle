The Khmer Glossaries are from:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/khmer/files/English-Khmer%20Glossary/English-Khmer%20Glossary%20of%20Computer%20Terms%20Version%203.2/

These are created by the KhmerOS project

There is no explicit license in the document but since they are hosted on
Sourceforge, which requires a FOSS license, we assume we may redistribute
them.

We have not included the:
* Mathematics
* Accounting
* Statistics, and
* Language
dictionaries due to size issues.

To prepare those do the following in OpenOffice.org
1) Delete the first 3 rows
2) Delete column B and D
3) Save as .csv
4) Run csv2po over the file
